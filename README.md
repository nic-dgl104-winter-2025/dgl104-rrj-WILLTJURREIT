# Rsearch and Reflection Journal
Research and Reflection Journal for DGL 104 course



# **Research & Reflection Journal**
 (Note: I will need to re-make this as I cannot find my file, I did do a clean up of my desktop due tyo Android studio and some files were deleted a week or 2 ago.. But I do remember having a living document I had been adding to. In order to complete this I will base it on my weekly hand written notes as I did take many notes in class and out of class.)

---


 ## **Week 8 (hours spent 6)**

 ## What I Learned in class:
 - The second half of this course will be more difficult, the intensity will be picking up.
 - When i learn to write down what I have learned it will make my learning more effective.
 - Documenting requires citing with proper resources, blog posts and videos.
 - This reflection is for me.
 - Each week I will be developing something. 
 - When documenting it is good to include what I did to test certain things and how it went.

##  Struggle points:
- I struggled with understanding what was required of me and what was not this course. This was due to the required and not required instructions, they had been blended and it was at times overwhelming, though you would not think it, possibly it was due to the amount of homework I had from all courses combined.


## What I learned: 
- I learned about TDD, which is a written document, 
       - Addresses technical concerns 
       - Specifies tech were going to use
       - Not implementation info 
       - holds high level concepts, clear do developer teams can understand and implement.


## What has been done:

1. **Research and reflection:**
   - I chose the programming language, **“Haskell”**.
   - Haskell is used for data analysis, machine learning, financial modeling, and is often employed as a teaching tool in functional programming courses. 
   - The language is great for tasks like complex algorithms, math, and problem-solving. It is widely used in the fintech industry, machine learning, and data processing.
   - One of Haskell’s key qualities is that it helps ensure correctness in programs.
   - Resources for learning Haskell are available on its official website.
   - Some of Haskell’s highlighted features include:
     - Statically typed
     - Purely functional
     - Type inference
     - Concurrency
     - Lazy evaluation
     - Packages
   - In conclusion, I would say that Haskell has a strong position in complex use cases.


## User Story about Spotify:

**As a User:**
- **I want to access one of my library's playlists so I can listen to my saved and find/save more music.**
  - A visible “Your Library” button is shown on the home screen.
  - Clicking the button opens a page where you can access your playlists.
  - The library of your playlists shows up right away, so you can pick and choose which one.

### As a user:
- **I want to open one of my playlists, so I can navigate the songs and artists.**
  - I can choose one of many artists to listen to in the playlist; there are multiple options.
  - When clicked on, the chosen song will play.

### As a user:
- **I want to find and add more music to my app.**
  - There is an "Add Songs" button, clearly labelled, easily found at the top left corner of the screen.
  - When clicked, the page changes to a scrollable list of songs and artists.
  - An add button, circular with a plus sign in the middle, is located on the right side for each option to add to the library.
  - When the button is clicked, the library is updated and I can browse for more music.

### As a user:
- **I want to ensure that the music I have downloaded has gone to the correct playlist.**
  - There is an "X" button in the top left corner to leave the search for new music.
  - When clicked, it returns to the previously selected playlist.
  - The song has been placed in the playlist that is currently playing.

### As a user:
- **I want to move this song to the correct playlist.**
  - 3 dots on the right side of the screen indicate there are options I can choose from related to this song.
  - Once clicked, a fractional screen appears, and it has a list of options; one is to "Add to Playlist", accompanied by an add button.
  - A list of playlist options appears, and once selected, there is a very clear “Done” button in green, which allows finishing the task of changing the location of the song.

### As a user:
- **My goals while using the app were accomplished without much effort. The easy navigation and well-designed UI reduced the cognitive load, resulting in a quality experience.**

## How I Spent My Time

I spent many hours researching and exploring the programming language **Haskell**. During this time, I used several resources to deepen my understanding, including:

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell)
- [Geeks_For_Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-haskell-programming-language/)
- [Youtube_Tutorial](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=haskel+programming+language+Youtube&cvid=02ab1ce0e74b48d9a4af3f459294c8f7&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQABhAMgYIAhAAGEAyBggDEAAYQDIGCAQQABhAMgYIBRAAGEAyBggGEAAYQDIGCAcQABhAMgYICBAAGEDSAQkxMDc5OGowajSoAgiwAgE&adppc=EDGEESS&PC=LCTS&ru=%2fsearch%3fq%3dhaskel%2bprogramming%2blanguage%2bYoutube%26cvid%3d02ab1ce0e74b48d9a4af3f459294c8f7%26gs_lcrp%3dEgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQABhAMgYIAhAAGEAyBggDEAAYQDIGCAQQABhAMgYIBRAAGEAyBggGEAAYQDIGCAcQABhAMgYICBAAGEDSAQkxMDc5OGowajSoAgiwAgE%26FORM%3dANAB01%26adppc%3dEDGEESS%26PC%3dLCTS&mmscn=vwrc&mid=E3D35F9F31EF32EBF01BE3D35F9F31EF32EBF01B&FORM=WRVORC&ntb=1&msockid=514fd36513c511f0921c09a86260a3a8)

These resources helped me grasp the core concepts of Haskell, such as its functional nature, type inference, and its applications in fields like data analysis and machine learning. 

This week's learnings made me realize that there is a wide variety of programming languages, each built for specific purposes. From the simplicity and versatility of languages like JavaScript to the precision of languages like Haskell for complex algorithms, it’s clear that selecting the right language for a particular task can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of development.

Additionally, I gained valuable insight into how **user stories** help developers focus on the real needs of users. By framing features and functionalities around what users truly require, user stories ensure that development stays aligned with practical use cases, making us better developers. Understanding and creating user stories enables us to better empathize with users and build applications that solve their problems in multiple ways.

# **Week 9 (hours spent 8-10)**

 ## What I Learned :
 - With Java if something is static  we will call the class name to access the instance.
 - Kotlin, this class we learned bout some ways to use Kotlin language by creating objects  and had some examples on the board I had followed along with. 
 - When we create our Group Project we should be able to show what Design Patterns we have used int he project. This should be specified in the documentation of the app. 



 ##  Struggle points:
- My largest struggle at this point was that with the slack post assignment, I was unable to find the list of issues. I looked everywhere to find them but had no luck. I made multiple posts on slack and messages to other students but had no good responses. I ended up needing to make this happen one way or the other, so the only student who had made a post on this topic I decided to look at his I chosen issue and see if there was a way that I would be able to contribute and collaborate then provide examples of this on slack. I believe I was successful in this assignment, showing that I am able to push myself and find creative ways to adapt and contribute.



## Learnings from This Week's Research and Assignments

This week, I spent about 8 hours researching and completing assignments related to the following topics:

#### [REQUIRED] **Application Development Coding Project Assignment**
- **Key Learning:**  
  I carefully reviewed the assignment description and rubric on Brightspace to understand the expectations. The assignment emphasizes the importance of collaboration, clear communication, and well-documented code in the development process.
- **Takeaway:**  
  A successful project requires clear planning, division of tasks, and consistent progress tracking in GitHub repositories. I also learned the importance of defining project goals and timelines early to ensure everyone is on the same page.

#### [REQUIRED] **Research and Reflection Guide**
- **Key Learning:**  
  This helped clarify how to effectively document and reflect on my research progress. The guide focuses on structuring my journal entries to provide deeper insights into my learning experiences.
- **Takeaway:**  
  This journal is a tool to track my thoughts, discoveries, and any challenges I face during the research process. It encourages me to document how I can apply new knowledge in my projects and how it aligns with my overall learning goals.

#### [REQUIRED]  **How to Contribute to Open Source**
- **Key Learning:**  
  I read the "How to Contribute to Open Source" guide on GitHub, which provided a detailed explanation of the various ways to contribute to open source projects, such as bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature requests.
- **Takeaway:**  
  I learned that contributing to open source isn't just about writing code but can also include reviewing pull requests, creating or updating documentation, and reporting bugs. I found it useful to identify the kinds of contributions that align with my skills and interests, such as improving project documentation.
  - **Contributing to Open Source Projects:**  
    I explored GitHub Explore and Open Source Friday to find projects that match my interests. One key takeaway was the value of selecting projects that have an active community and clear contribution guidelines.

#### [REQUIRED] **Application Development Coding Project (Group Work)**
- **Key Learning:**  
  I began collaborating with my group members, setting up our GitHub repository, and organizing our project tasks. The process highlighted the importance of version control and effective collaboration using Git which I do feel we are struggling to start off, but will meet the requirements by the end.
- **Takeaway:**  
  Working with others on GitHub requires good communication and version control practices. It’s important to Know each member's role and stay aligned on the overall goals of the project. We need to have Regular check-ins with the instructor will help ensure we’re on track.


- **Chosen Language on Slack:** 
 **Choose a language for your APP Development Project Code**
 I have discussed the Project with a student who I plan to partner with on the project, He has experience in a programming-languages called django and python and for de DB sqlite. I have heard of these languages in the past in relation to game development, and other. I believe it is important to have exposure to many different languages to help become prepared for working in the industry.
 I do not have any experience with these languages, and so it will be difficult for me to learn at the same time as participating in this project, but I am willing to try.
 One reason I would like to learn these languages is that it might help me to understand the similarities and differences between the languages. If I work with a more experienced programmer, it may help me to learn more about programming in general. I have read about Python, and I see it is used for game development, which is an interest of mine.


#### [REQUIRED] **Slack Summary**
- **Key Learning:**  
  I identified a relevant issue in an open-source project, and shared my findings on Slack, providing a link to the issue and explaining why it was a good candidate for contribution. This exercise allowed me to practice articulating the problem and its potential impact.
- **Takeaway:**  
  Contributing to open source requires not only understanding the code but also being able to identify and explain issues effectively. This activity helped improve my skills in problem-solving and communication within a collaborative environment.



## Here is my Slack post:

### "Write A Summary On Slack"
- **Issue Title:** [Looking for Maintainers #184](https://github.com/thombashi/tcconfig/issues/184)
- **Why This Is a Good Opportunity for Me to Contribute:**
  As a beginner programmer, I’m eager to gain more experience in maintaining and debugging code. While my experience is limited, I believe I can assist with investigating issues and potentially provide fixes or workarounds under guidance.
  
- **From the discussion in the GitHub issue thread:**  
  [Pull Request #145](https://github.com/thombashi/tcconfig/pull/145)  
  The error is not always reproducible, which makes it challenging for contributors to pinpoint the cause. As a beginner, I can contribute by researching different environments and documenting the exact steps required to reproduce the issue. This would help improve the project’s clarity and assist in debugging the problem more effectively.

- **Additional Contribution Ideas:**  
  I can also focus on documenting various operating system versions and configurations where the error occurs. This would be valuable for both other users and maintainers. Research-based contributions are a great way for me to get involved, even with my limited programming experience. A contribution doesn't have to be limited to just programming tasks.

- *(I used Hang's link in the post to find the issue I chose)*

### Design Patterns

 - Design patterns are reusable code fragments that solve common, well-understood coding problems.
  - On their own, design patterns don’t do much in a program.
- When applied to the right problem, they are **safe** and  **maintainable** solutions that are recognizable by experienced developers.
- They greatly enhance the **long-term maintainability** of a programming code.
- Design patterns are methods for solving coding problems.   
- There are various kinds of a design pattern, many times dependent on programming languages or families of languages.

- **Implementation Examples:**  
  - The following video presents design patterns in **Java** and **Kotlin**.
  - Plenty of implementations are also available in other languages, such as:

## **Week 10 (hours spent 6-10)**


## What I Learned in Class

This week in class, I gained more knowledge into the **Model-View** architectural patterns (MV*), with a focus on **MVVM** and **MVC**. I learned that **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) is the most commonly used pattern in mobile development for iOS and Android apps. MVVM provides a cleaner separation of concerns compared to **MVC** (Model-View-Controller), which was traditionally used in iOS development before the advent of SwiftUI. I now understand that MVC works by separating the data model, user interface, and user input, but MVVM takes it a step further, allowing for easier management of the view state, which is ideal for mobile apps.

## Struggle Points

- **Identifying an issue to contribute to**: One of the biggest struggles this week was finding an appropriate issue to fix. The repository I decided to contribute to had many reported problems, but the issues were often hard to reproduce due to differing execution environments. This made it difficult to find a clear, straightforward problem to solve.
- **Contributing with limited programming experience**: Given my limited programming background, I found it challenging to figure out how to make a meaningful contribution to the codebase. The lack of detailed contribution guidelines in the repository made it harder for me to understand how to begin contributing.

## What I Learned

I learned that **open source contributions** are not always about writing code. For example, in the project I chose, I contributed by documenting different error cases and helping to locate inconsistencies within the codebase. This kind of **research-based contribution** can be valuable to a project, especially when the maintainers are dealing with environmental inconsistencies that are difficult to reproduce. 
Additionally, I realized the importance of **clear contribution guidelines**. The repository I chose did not have a CONTRIBUTING.md file, making it unclear how new contributors should proceed. This is something I will keep in mind when working on open-source projects in the future.

## What Has Been Done

- I identified a relevant issue to work on: **"Looking for maintainers" (#184)** in the **tcconfig** GitHub repository.
- I tried contributed by researching the environment-related issues and documenting the errors to help the maintainers understand the problem better.
- I provided insights into the **lack of clear guidelines** in the repository, which could discourage potential contributors.
- I participated in Slack discussions and summarized my findings on how to contribute to open-source projects based on my experiences this week.

## How I Spent My Time

- **Researching the repository**: I spent a significant amount of time going through the tcconfig repository and identifying issues. I explored the error logs and tried to understand the inconsistencies across different environments.
- **Documenting errors and providing insights**: I helped document specific errors, noting down the systems where issues were occurring.
- **Reviewing GitHub Issues and Discussions**: I followed ongoing discussion in the GitHub issues to understand the challenges the maintainers faced. I then shared my findings in the Slack channel, explaining how I could help with documentation and research-based contributions.

## Follow-Up Questions and Reflections

- **What is the hardest/most challenging thing you had to do this week for DGL 104? How did you overcome this challenge?**

   The hardest thing I had to do was figure out how to contribute with my limited programming skills. Initially, I felt overwhelmed because many of the issues were beyond my coding capabilities. However, I overcame this by focusing on **documentation-based contributions** instead of directly diving into coding. This allowed me to still make an impact on the project while learning more about the contribution process.

# Week 11 (Hours spent: 6)

## What I Learned in Class & at home:

This week, we focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, which was particularly relevant to the ongoing development of our group project. Key OOP principles were:

- **Inheritance**: Helps in creating base classes **AllUser** and allows other classes  **ManagerUser**, **CustomerUser** to inherit and extend functionality, making the codebase more modular and reducing redundancy.
- **Encapsulation**: Grouping related data and functions together in a class, like encapsulating workout details within a **WorkOut** class. This promotes data integrity and allows for controlled access to data.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows methods to be implemented in different forms depending on the object (e.g., defining one **addWorkout()** method that behaves differently for different user roles).

I also learned that **Python**, the language we’re using in our gym app project, is fully capable of OOP and supports multiple paradigms like **Imperative**, **Functional**, and **Procedural** programming, making it a versatile choice for our app development.

## Struggle Points:

1. **Applying Polymorphism in a Large Codebase**:I understand the concept of polymorphism, I am struggling with how to apply it seamlessly in a large, dynamic project like the gym app. Deciding how much differentiation should exist between methods for different user types can be tricky, especially in complex systems.
   
2. **Understanding Encapsulation in Django Models**:I can see how encapsulation works in general OOP terms, implementing it with Django's ORM **Object-Relational Mapping** will require more research for me to get a better understanding.

## What I Learned:

- **OOP in Practice**: By applying OOP principles to the gym app project, I learned how these concepts can make a project more scalable and easier to manage. **Inheritance** helps reduce redundancy by enabling us to create parent classes like AllUser and derive specific user types from them. **Encapsulation** helps manage complex data, such as workouts, by keeping related functions and attributes together in one class. **Polymorphism** allows us to define generic methods like addWorkout() that can behave differently for each user type, which reduces code duplication and increases maintainability.

- **Python as a Multi-Paradigm Language**: Python’s support for OOP, along with other paradigms like **functional** and **procedural programming**, gives us a lot of flexibility when building applications. I did struggle with this though in a sense that I had difficulty to figure out how to actually connect the codes to python, and how the database is hooked to it, I felt like it was too much for me to take on learning as I am very new to coding. 

## What Has Been Done:

- **OOP Concepts Applied to the Gym App**: We discussed and planned how OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism could be applied to the backend of our gym app when in class. These principles will help structure the user roles, workouts, and gym services more efficiently.
- **Python OOP Research**: I researched how Python handles OOP and its multi-paradigm nature. I found that Python is well-suited for the job, as it offers clear, readable syntax while supporting OOP and other programming styles.

## How I Spent My Time:

- [Research about OOP in Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/): Spent time learning more about how Python implements OOP concepts and its multi-paradigm capabilities.

- [Planning OOP Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-oops-concepts/): Discussed with the team how to apply inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to our app, particularly focusing on user roles and workout data.

- [Encapsulation in Django](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/): Tried implementing encapsulation within Django models to manage workout data and user details effectively.

- [Collaborating with Team](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests): Worked with my team to break down the backend requirements and how best to organize the code using OOP principles for scalability and efficiency.

# Week 12 (hours spent 8-10)

## What I Learned in class:
This week we focused on functional programming tools like **map**, **filter**, and **reduce**. These tools help make code more efficient by transforming collections in a concise way. I also learned how these tools can improve readability and simplify code, especially in handling data collections.

## Struggle points:
The biggest challenge was getting used to functional programming tools since I’m more familiar with traditional loops and imperative programming. It took a bit to adjust, but I’m getting the hang of it. I have only been in learning about programming since september 8 months ago, and knew nothing before then.

## What I learned:
- A bit about **Functional tools** like **map** and **filter**. 
- Team collaboration and communication is key to being successful.
- That I want to know our code inside and out for the final presentation.

## What has been done:
- Contributed to front-end features like login, team management, routine views, routines, and Mockups and other.  
- Participated in team discussions and reviewed code on GitHub.
- Did research to ensure I'm prepared for the final presentation.

## How I Spent My Time:
Basically, I have such a massive amount of homework, I have spent my time doing almost nothing at all but homework.. so I am doing what I can. All my time was homework. 

---
# Week 13 (hours spent = lots)

- Honestly, this week has just been a grind and I have not taken many notes. I can say that I have learned how to start and host a teams meeting myself this week.
-  I learned that I lost my entire Research and reflection journal.. 
- I plan to still do more studying, before the presentation, and one last final test, and final check on the project, 

**Testing** - I did not mention much about the debugging and testing, but one way I contribute to the testing is I try out the websites links and buttons, features, and run through the entire thing a bunch of times while documenting any inconsistencies, as well as looking over it with a magnify glass for any issues. Then I report back to my group. 

--- 

## **Conclusion:**

Over the past weeks, I’ve gained valuable knowledge into architectural patterns, OOP principles, and Python, applying them to our gym app project. I’ve faced challenges in contributing to open-source projects and adapting to new programming paradigms, but I’ve focused on research-based contributions and collaborating effectively, and with my team I have became an important piece of pulling the group together, increasing communication, and productivity. As we approach the final stages, I feel more confident in applying these concepts and preparing for our final presentation.
